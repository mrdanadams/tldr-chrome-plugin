TLDR is a Chrome plugin that provides a "feeling lucky" instant search; instead of search results the plugin loads the first result directly. TLDR is great for looking up code references or anything where the first result is usually what you want.

[What does "tl;dr" mean?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn't_read)

## Usage

In the omnibar simply type `!` followed by tab or space and your search terms. As you type the window below will be updated to reflect the best match for your search.

Hit `esc` to discard the search and go back to the page you started on. Hitting `enter` will leave you on the search result.
